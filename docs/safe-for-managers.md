<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<h3 id="activate">How to activate your new allocation</h3>
<p>
	After your application for access to ARCHER2 has been approved by the
	relevant funding body, your new allocation will need to be activated. This can be
	done by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk">ARCHER2
		helpdesk</a>. Please quote your grant reference number, the start and
	the end date of the grant, and the name of the PI.
</p>
<p>
	The details will be checked and your new allocation will be set up on
	the service machine. If your new allocation is a follow-on to your existing project,
	you can request for it to be set up as a new <a href="#period">period
		allocation</a> under the same project. Alternatively you can request
	for it to be set up as a new project. Once the project is set up, the
	PI will receive an email with all the project details.
</p>


<h3 id="andnext">Your allocation has been set up as a project on the
	service. Your first steps.</h3>
<p>Here are some of the things you should consider doing; not all of
	them will be needed for every project.</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="../safe-for-users#chpass">Change your own SAFE password</a></li>
	<li><a href="#selfac">Set up an account on the service machine for
			yourself</a></li>
	<li><a href="#regusers">Make sure other project users get registered</a></li>
	<li><a href="#projman">Designate one or more users as managers of your
			project</a></li>
	<li><a href="#projgrp">Decide whether you need project groups within
			your project, in order to administer time and other resources</a></li>
</ol>


<h3 id="selfac">How to get your own account on the service machine</h3>
<p>If you are not going to work on the machine yourself, you do not need
	to do this. You can administer your project through SAFE alone. But if
	you want a service machine account:</p>

<h2 id="managing-resources">Managing your allocated resources</h2>

<h3 id="period">What is "period allocation"?</h3>
<p>A period allocation is an amount of compute time which has been allocated for a
	project to use within the specified time period. Period allocations are
	valid for a specific resource pool (machine) and have definitive start
	and end dates, which usually coincide with the dates of your EPSRC
	grant or project award. When the end date of
	the period allocation passes, any leftover compute time will automatically
	expire.</p>
<p>You can view and manage your period allocation via SAFE.</p>

	<li>Scroll down to Time Budgets and Click on <em>Manage Group Time Allocations</em></li>
	<li>Click on the small arrow beside <em>How to Manage Your Budgets</em> for detailed instructions.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	You will then see the details of your current live allocation. <em><u>Please check the dates by <em>Allocation Period</em>

</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
	You can manage the allocation by <a href="#projgrp">setting up project
		groups</a> and <a href="#mvtime">allocating compute time to project groups</a>.
	Project management tasks for the period allocation can be carried out
	at any time, but the allocation will be active, i.e. usable, only
	between the specified dates. Thus, you can set up project groups in
	advance.
</p>


<h3 id="projgrp">How can I set up project groups within my project?</h3>

<p>Project groups can be used to administer time and other resources
	within your project.</p>

</ol>




<h3 id="delgrp">How can I delete a project group?</h3>


<p>
	You can only delete a project group if it has no resources or members.
	You must remove all its <a href="#remu">members</a> and all its <a
		href="#mvtime">time</a>. Also, if it has <a href="#space">disk quotas
		set</a>, it cannot be deleted; they will have to be removed first.
	Then:

		src="../../img/video_play_icon.jpg" alt="Play video"
		title="Play video" style="float: right; border: 0"></a>
 -->		
						
	<li>Go to the Menu <em>Projects</em> and select the <em>project</em>
		you wish to delete the sub-group from.
	</li>
	<li>Scroll down to project groups and click on the small arrow beside Project Groups 
     to expand and display all the groups in the project.</li> 
	<li>Select the project sub-group you want to delete. </li>
	<li>Scroll to the bottom of the page and click <em>Delete</em>. This will ask for confirmation that you wish
		to delete the sub-group. Click <em>Yes</em>.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Deleting a group involves removing its various directories. A human
	has to do this, so there will be a short delay.</p>


<h3 id="time">How can I administer time within my project?</h3>

<p>
	Time is measured in <a
		href="http://www.archer.ac.uk/access/au-calculator/"><em>allocation
			units</em></a> (kAUs), and is held in <em>budgets</em>. Every project
	group has its own budget. There are always at least two project groups
	in your project:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <em>general group</em>, which has the same code as the project
		itself. Every member of the project is a member of this group, so the
		time in its budget is available to them all.
	</li>
	<li>The <em>reserve</em> project group, which has a name of form <em>t01-reserve</em>.
		It has no members, so no one can use the time in its budget. This
		budget can be used to hold time which the PI or project manager wishes
		to hold in reserve for later use.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Initially, all your time is in the general group's budget. If you are
	happy with all your users using the same budget, you can leave things
	as they are.</p>

<p>
	If you wish to divide the time up between groups, you can <a
		href="#projgrp">create a project group</a> for each group. In this
	case you will probably want to move all the time out the general group,
	since this can be used by everyone. 
</p>

<p>
	You may wish to <a href="#oneuser">give time just to a single user</a>.
	This is a special case of a project group: one with only one member.
</p>

<p>The reserve budget is provided so that if you wish you can control
	the use of time by your project members: you can keep most of the time
	in your reserve budget, and move it to the other budgets as required.
	We recommend that you should do this, even if you don't need to create
	other project groups.</p>


<h3 id="mvtime">How can I move time between budgets?</h3>

		title="Play video" style="float: right; border: 0"></a>
	<li>Go to the Menu <em>Projects</em> and select the <em>project</em>
		you wish to work with. This displays a panel with information for the

    <li>Click the <em>Move</em> button</li>
	<li>Click the <em>Submit Budget Allocation Changes</em> button.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Do not forget the Submit step, or nothing will happen.</p>


<h3 id="oneuser">
	<a></a> How can I allocate time to a single user?
</h3>

<p>As all the time in a project group is shared by all its members, the
	only way to reserve some time for a single user is to create a project
	group for that user alone.</p>

<ol>
	<li><a href="#projgrp">Create a new project group</a> for the user. For
		example, if we are in project <em>t01</em> and the user is <em>fred</em>,
		you might call the new project group <em>t01-fred</em></li>
	<li><a href="#addu">Add the user to the new project group</a></li>
	<li><a href="#mvtime">Move the time</a> you wish the user to have into
		the new project group</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember that time in the general group's budget is accessible to
	all, so you will probably want to move all of the project's time away
	from there.</p>


<h3 id="space">How can I administer disk space?</h3>

<p>
	Start by reading the discussion of the <a href="#time">administration
		of time</a>, as the administration of disk space is related to this,
	and is also done using project groups. The two project groups which
	exist in each project can also be used for administering space.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <em>general group</em>, which has the same code as the project
		itself, includes every member of the project. The disk quotas of this
		project group can therefore be used by them all.
	</li>
	<li>The <em>reserve</em> project group, which has a name of form <em>t01-reserve</em>,
		has no members, so no one can use the disk space which is in its
		quotas. You can use these quotas to hold space which you want to hold
		in reserve for later.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Homespace and workspace are administered separately. A project has an
	overall limit for each of these. Within that limit, every portion of
	space must belong to one or other of the project group quotas. Thus, to
	start with, all the homespace (for example) allocated to a project is
	either in the general homespace quota or the reserve homespace quota.
	Space never belongs to more than one group quota. [The reserve quota is
	not a real quota, in fact. It has no existence on the service
	machine&mdash;just in the database.]</p>

<p>Beyond the general and reserve quotas, you can also have quotas for
	the project groups which you create. But this is not compulsory. If
	you're thinking about using project group quotas, you need to be aware
	that they are implemented using Unix groups, which are only just
	adequate for the task.</p>

<p>
	Let's use homespace as an example&mdash;workspace is similar. Suppose
	you are project <em>t01</em>. To start with, one Unix group will be
	assigned to this project. The homespace directories for all users will
	be in directory
	<tt>/home/t01/t01/</tt>
	&mdash;this is where the general group is held. User <em>john</em>, for
	example, will have directory
	<tt>/home/t01/t01/john/</tt>
	as his homespace directory. (In fact, if this is the first project he
	joined, that's where he will log in.) Any file created in any of the
	directoriesunder
	<tt>/home/t01/t01/</tt>
	will belong to the Unix group for project <em>t01</em>.
</p>

<p>
	If you create a project group <em>t01-a</em> with no homespace quota,
	this will not change. But the moment you give a homespace quota to this
	project group, a Unix group will be assigned to it and a directory will
	be created for it:
	<tt>/home/t01/t01-a/</tt>
	. If user <em>john</em> is a member of this project group, he will have
	a directory
	<tt>/home/t01/t01-a/john/</tt>
	. Any files he creates under that directory will belong to <em>t01-a</em>
	and will be counted against its quota.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, <em>john</em> is still a member of the general project
	group, so he can still create files there. If he belongs to other
	project groups which have quotas, he'll have directories for these as
	well. He can only create files in the project groups he is a member of,
	since he can't access the directories of the other groups. It's up to
	him to make sure that he creates his files in the right places, so that
	they get charged to the right project groups.
</p>

<!--
<p>That's the theory, but unfortunately there are ways for users to get round this system (by mistake and on purpose), and there's nothing we can do about this, apart from changing the group IDs of files when we notice it happening.  We are at the limit of what the operating
system's technology can do.</p>
-->

<p>
	You should also note that once you have instituted project group
	quotas, there's no easy way back. Removing them and reassigning all the
	files to other groups is a complex job and will require special
	arrangement with the system team&mdash;send a request to the <a
		href="mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk">helpdesk</a> if you need to do
	this.
</p>

<p>
	Most projects in fact use their project groups only for administering
	time, and allow their users to have access to all their space. You
	could if you wish make use of <a href="#persquota">user quotas</a> to
	stop individual users from taking too much space.
</p>

<p>[Note that the above points do not apply to the reserve quotas, since
	they don't exist on the service machine. They're just a book-keeping
	fiction, and using them is cost free. We recommend this to any project
	which is concerned about running out of space.]</p>


<h3 id="mvspace">How can I create a quota for a project group, or move
	space between quotas?</h3>

<p>
	First, read the <a href="#space">discussion of space administration</a>.
	If you are still determined to use project group quotas, this is how.
</p>

<p><a href="../safe-for-users#login">Login to SAFE</a> Then:</p>

<ol>

	<li>Go to the Menu <em>Projects </em> and select the <em>project</em>
		you wish to work on. This will display a panel with the project
		information.
	</li>
	<li>Scroll down and click the small arrow beside "Disk Quotas" to expand the section. </li>
	<li>In the <em>Group Quotas</em> section, click on button beside the File System you wish to work on.	</li>
	<li>You will now see a list of your project groups, including the
		general and reserve groups. Project groups which have no quota will
		show the note <em>No quota set</em>
	</li>
	<li>Click the small arrow beside "Instructions..." to display detailed instructions.</li>
	<li>Click the <em>Move From</em> and <em>Move To</em> buttons of the
		groups you want to change
	</li>
	<li>Fill in the number of Gb to move in the box</li>
	<li>Click <em>Move</em></li>
	<li>Repeat until you have entered all the moves you wish to make</li>
	<li>Click <em>Submit</em> and the move instructions will then be carried out.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Do not forget the final Submit step, or nothing will happen. The act of moving
	quota space to a project group which has no quota set converts that
	project group to one with a group quota, administered by a Unix group,
	as discussed <a href="#space">earlier</a>.
</p>

<p>Quota changes are actually carried out by a human being. Once this
	has been done, you will receive an email informing you. If you ask for
	the quota to be reduced below the current size of the files in the
	project group, the human will reject your request, and you will get an
	email saying this.</p>




<h3 id="persquota">How can I set a quota for an individual user?</h3>

<p>User disk quotas are completely separate from project group quotas. A
	user quota simply places a limit on the amount of space which a
	particular user can occupy in workspace or homespace. There's nothing
	to stop you setting user quotas which add up to more (or less) than the
	total space. To set a quota for a user or users:</p>

<p><a href="../safe-for-users#login">Login to SAFE</a> Then:</p>
<ol>

	<li>Go to the Menu <em>Projects managed</em> and select the <em>project</em>
		you wish to work on. This will display a panel with the project
		information.
	</li>
	<li>Scroll down to <em>Disk Quotas</em></li>
	<li>In the <em>User Quotas</em> section, click <em>Home</em> or <em>Work</em></li>
	<li>You will see a list of users. Enter a value for each of the users
		whose quota you wish to change</li>
	<li>Click <em>Submit Changes</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Once again, these quota changes are carried out by a human. Once they
	have finished, you will receive an email.</p>

<p>As with group quotas on the work file-system you can only be
	absolutely sure of writing data when you are more than 7Gb below your
	quota limit.</p>

	<li>Click on either the "Reject" or "Approve" button to reject or accept them.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you now accept the user, they will get an account. This is the
	last chance to stop someone who should not be there! Take a few seconds
	to check the user's details, especially their email address, to make
	sure that they are who they say they are. Please check their
	nationality as well: it's your responsibility to make sure this is
	right.</p>

<p>
	When you accept a user, the systems team is automatically requested to
	create the account on the service machine. When this has been done, the
	user is emailed; allow a working day for this. The user can then login
	to SAFE and <a href="../safe-for-users#getpass">pick up their
		password on the service machine</a>.
</p>


<p>When you click Accept you will then be taken to a list of all the 
<a href="#projgrp">Project Groups</a> in your project, so you can easily
add the new user to the group(s) they will be using.
Simply tick the box against any groups they should be a member of, and then click "OK"

	these groups. (If you manage a parent group you automatically manage
	all its children). Sub-group managers can also accept new people into
	the project and run reports on the project.</p>

	<a href="../safe-for-users#login">Login to SAFE</a>. Then:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Go to the Menu <em>Projects managed</em> and select the <em>project</em>
		you wish to work on.
	</li>
	<li>Under <em>Project groups</em> you can see the current state of each
		project group's budgets. If it uses disk quotas, you will see these,
		together with how much of is in use.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>If a project group's use of a quota is getting close to the maximum,
	it is highlighted in pink.</p>

<p>The budget values displayed are updated every morning, and the values
	shown for disk use are updated four times a day. For this reason, these
	values may not all be completely up-to-date. If there is a lot of
	activity in your project, the numbers shown could be significantly
	different from the current ones.</p>


<h3 id="phist">How to track what my project's users and project groups

<h3 id="udisk">How to check how much space my project's users are
	occupying</h3>

<p>
	Use the Report Generator (see the <a href="#phist">previous question</a>),
	and select <em>User disk use</em>. The Report Generator displays the
	history of disk use&mdash;to see the current use, make sure that the
	reporting period includes the present moment. The disk usage values
	known to the database are updated four times a day, so if there is a
	lot of activity in your project, the numbers shown could be
	significantly different from the current ones.
</p>

<p>There's an unresolvable problem with this: if a user has an account
	which belongs to more than one project, the disk usage shown for that
	account will be the total that the account is using in all those
	projects combined.</p>


<h3 id="more">How to request more resources (AUs and disk space)</h3>

<p>
	If you need more home or work space, contact the <a
		href="http://www.archer.ac.uk/support/helpdesk/">helpdesk</a>. We will
	always receive such requests sympathetically, and it is likely that we
	will be able to allocate some more to your project.
</p>

<p>If you need extra time, you should contact the research council which
	is funding your project. The helpdesk cannot allocate time without
	authorisation from them.</p>
