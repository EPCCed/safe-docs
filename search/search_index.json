The two project groups which exist in each project can also be used for administering space.</p> <ul> <li>The general group, which has the same code as the project itself, includes every member of the project. The disk quotas of this project group can therefore be used by them all.</li> <li>The reserve project group, which has a name of form t01-reserve, has no members, so no one can use the disk space which is in its quotas. You can use these quotas to hold space which you want to hold in reserve for later.</li> </ul> <p>Different file systems are administered separately. A project may have access to multiple file systems on multiple different service machines. Within the disk space allocated on a particular file system every portion of space must belong to one or other of the project group quotas. Thus, to start with, all the quota allocated to a project on a file system is either in the general quota or the reserve quota for that file system. Space never belongs to more than one group quota. [The reserve quota is not a real quota, in fact. It has no existence on the service machine - just in the database.]</p> <p>Note</p> <p>You cannot move disk space on one file system to another file system - you can only allocate file space on a file system to group quotas on te same file system.</p> <p>Beyond the general and reserve quotas, you can also have quotas for the project groups which you create. But this is not compulsory. If you qre thinking about using project group quotas, you need to be aware that they are implemented using Unix groups, which are only just adequate for the task.</p> <p>Let us use an ARCHER2 work file system as an example (<code>a2fs-work1</code>, your project may have access to a different file system). Suppose you are project t01. To start with, one Unix group will be assigned to this project. The directories for all users will be in directory <code>/work/t01/t01/</code> \u2014 this is where the general group is held. User john, for example, will have directory <code>/work/t01/t01/john/</code> as his work directory. Any file created in any of the directories under <code>/work/t01/t01/</code> will belong to the Unix group for project t01.</p> <p>If you create a project group t01-a with no quota on ARCHER2 work, this will not change. On the \"Group quotas\" SAFE page you will see the new project group and under \"Usage\" and \"Quota\" you will see \"Locked\" \u2014 as the group has no quota, it cannot be populated. But the moment you give a quota to this project group on ARCHER2 work, a Unix group will be assigned to it and a directory will be created for it: <code>/work/t01/t01-a/</code> If user john is a member of this project group, he will have a directory <code>/work/t01/t01-a/john/</code>.  Any files he creates under that directory will belong to t01-a and will be counted against its quota.</p> <p>Of course, john is still a member of the general project group, so he can still create files there. If he belongs to other project groups which have quotas, he will have directories for these as well. He can only create files in the project groups he is a member of, since he cannot access the directories of the other groups. It is up to him to make sure that he creates his files in the right places, so that they get charged to the right project groups.</p> <p>You should also note that once you have instituted project group quotas, there is no easy way back. Removing them and reassigning all the files to other groups is a complex job and will require special arrangement with the service team \u2014 send a request to the appropriate Service Desk.</p> <p>Most projects, in fact, use their project groups only for administering time, and allow their users to have access to all their space. You could, if you wish, make use of user quotas (if they are supported on the file system you have access to) to stop individual users from taking too much space.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The above points do not apply to the reserve quotas, since they do not exist on the service machine. They are just a book-keeping fiction, and using them is cost free. We recommend this to any project which is concerned about running out of space.</p>"},{"location":"safe-for-managers/#how-can-i-create-a-quota-for-a-project-group-or-move-space-between-quotas","title":"How can I create a quota for a project group, or move space between quotas?","text":"<p>First, read the discussion of space administration.
