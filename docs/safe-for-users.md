# SAFE for users

This section covers the use of SAFE to:

  - Manage your personal details and preferences
  - Manage your user accounts on different systems and services

[SAFE](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/) is an online service management system developed by [EPCC](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk).
Through SAFE, individual users can request machine accounts, reset passwords, see available resources and track their usage. 
All users must be registered on SAFE before they can apply for their machine account.

### <a id="register"></a>How to register on SAFE

!!! Warning
    We have seen issues with Gmail blocking emails from SAFE so we recommend that users
    use their institutional/work email address rather than Gmail addresses to register 
    for SAFE accounts.

1. Go to the correct SAFE login page
     - DiRAC Users: [DiRAC SAFE login page](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/dirac/)
     - Other systems: [EPCC SAFE login page](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/)
2. Click "Create an account"
3. Fill in your personal details.  You can come back later and change them if you wish
4. Click "Register"
5. You are now registered. The SAFE will send an email to the email address you
   provided. This will contain a single-use link you can use to set your password.

At this point your account is registered on the SAFE but you do not have a machine account to be
able to login to services other than SAFE. To obtain a machine account you should follow the steps
to [Request a machine account](#getac).

<a id="personssh"></a>
!!! Hint
    If you are going to be requesting a machine account and logging onto to services, you may
    want to create a password-protected ssh key pair and upload the public key into SAFE as part of your Personal Details. 
    A key uploaded here will be used as the default key for any machine account you request.

### <a id="login"></a> How to login to SAFE and Overview of Main Page

1. Go to the correct SAFE login page
     - DiRAC Users: [DiRAC SAFE login page](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/dirac/)

2. Type in the email address you have registered with
3. Type in your SAFE password
4. Click "Login"
5. You are now on the Main Page and here you can see Menus along the top which give access to SAFE functionality

### <a id="inst-id"></a> How to use institutional login

If your home institution provides a single-sign-on system you may be able to link this to your SAFE account
and use this to log into the SAFE instead of a SAFE specific password

1. [Login to SAFE](#login)
2. Go to the Menu *Your details* - *Register Identities* - *Register institutional ID*
3. Select your organisation (most academic institutions should be available)
4. Log into your institution

You should be redirected back to the SAFE with an "Identity registered" message.

If you get a "No remote identity" message then your home institution may not be releasing any identifying
information to the SAFE. You may be able to resolve this by contacting your local IT support.

Once your identity is linked you will be able to use it instead of the SAFE specific password.

#### <a id="use-inst-id"></a> How to use your Institutional Identity to log into SAFE

This can be safely ignored - no changes will be made if the link is not used.

## <a id="machac"></a> Your user account on the service machine

### <a id="getac"></a> How to request a machine account


1. [Login to SAFE](#login)
2. Go to the Menu *Login accounts* and select *Request login account* 
3. Choose the project you want the account for in the "Project" box and click "Next"
4. Select the machine you want the account for from the available machines and click "Next"
5. The next step differs for the EPCC SAFE and DiRAC SAFE:
     - **For EPCC SAFE:** Enter the username you would prefer to use on the service machine and (optionally) add the public part of an SSH key pair to use for login
     - **For DiRAC SAFE:** Your username is set for you, you may (optionally) add the public part of an SSH key pair to use for login
1. Click "Request"

Next you will be asked to accept the Service Terms and Conditions of Access, by clicking the
appropriate button.  When you do this, you will be sent an  acknowledgment by email.

Now you have to wait for your PI or project manager to accept your request to register. When
this has happened, the systems team are prompted to create your account on the service machine.
Once this has been done, you will be sent an email. If the service machine is configured to use passwords you can then [pick up your password](#getpass) for the service machine from your SAFE account.
	
!!! notes
    - Every username must be unique.
    - Some machines including ARCHER2 and Cirrus require you to create a new machine account with a unique username for each project you work on.  In cases, usernames cannot be used on multiple projects, even if the previous project has finished.  
    - Some machines require you to have set up an ssh key in SAFE before you can request your machine account.
    - For DiRAC system accounts, your username is set for you

!!! hint
	If TOTP MFA is required for machine access, and you have a Login account on that machine which does not have MFA set up, then
    the 'Login accounts' menu item will be highlighted and the account name will also be highlighted.  Click on the account name
    to see further details of what action is required.

!!! hint
    If you set up an ssh key under "Personal Details" in SAFE, then that key will be used now
    as the default ssh key for your new account. If you do not have any ssh key set up then you
    may need to create a password-protected ssh key pair and upload the public key in SAFE.
    You can add a default key for all new accounts under your
    ["Personal Details"](#how-to-change-your-personal-details-on-safe), or add a key specific
    to this account using the "Add Credential" button.

### <a id="genssh"></a> How to generate an SSH key pair

You may need to generate an SSH key pair protected by a passphrase to access HPC systems.

Using a [terminal](#command-line-terminal) (the command line), set up a key pair that contains
your e-mail address and enter a passphrase you will use to unlock the
key:

    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your@email.com"
    ...
    -bash-4.1$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your@email.com"
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/Home/user/.ssh/id_rsa): [Enter]
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Passphrase]
    Enter same passphrase again: [Passphrase]
    Your identification has been saved in /Home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.
    Your public key has been saved in /Home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
    The key fingerprint is:
    03:d4:c4:6d:58:0a:e2:4a:f8:73:9a:e8:e3:07:16:c8 your@email.com
    The key's randomart image is:
    +--[ RSA 2048]----+
    |    . ...+o++++. |
    | . . . =o..      |
    |+ . . .......o o |
    |oE .   .         |
    |o =     .   S    |

1. [Login to SAFE](#login)
2. Go to the Menu *Login accounts*, select the account from the drop down list.
3. Select *Remove MFA-Token*  and then click *Yes* when asked to confirm.

### <h3 id="reset_machine"></a> How to reset a password on your machine account

!!! important
    Only for services which require a password

If you still remember your current machine account password, you can simply log in to the service
machine as normal and then use the `passwd` command.

```
passwd
```

You will then be prompted to enter your current password, and then your new password twice.
Your password must comply with the [password policy](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/about/policies/passwords_usernames).

If you have forgotten your current password, or it has expired, then a new password can be set via the SAFE. The SAFE supports two possible ways of doing this depending on how the machine is set-up. 

 1. You can request your password be re-set to a single use random password.
 2. You can change your password directly via a SAFE form.

Usually only one of these will be available. Direct password changes will only be possible on machines that are very tightly integrated with the SAFE.

To request a password reset:

1. [Login to SAFE](#login)
2. Go to the Menu *Login accounts* and select the account you need the new password for
3. Click *username* which displays details of this service machine account.
4. Click * Request Password Reset*
5. Click *Yes* to confirm

Now the systems team will change your password. When this has been done, you will be informed by email;
this means that you can come back to SAFE and [pick up your new password](#getpass).

To change or set a password directly from the SAFE:

1. [Login to SAFE](#login)
2. Go to the Menu *Login accounts* and select the account you need the new password for
3. Click *username* which displays details of this service machine account.
4. Click * Set Password*
5. Enter your new password in the two password boxes.
6. Click * Change Password*

There may be a short delay while the password update takes place.

### <h3 id="getpass"></a> How can I pick up my password for the service machine?

Wait till you receive the email with your details.  Then:

1. [Login to SAFE](#login). 
2. Go to the Menu *Login accounts* and click on the account username for which you want to look up
   the password. This will display details of your account. 
3. Click *View Login Account Password*
4. Your password to the service machine will be displayed
  
!!! Note
    ARCHER2 account passwords are also sometimes refered to as LDAP passwords by the system

This password is generated randomly by the software. It is best to copy-and-paste it across when you
log in to the service machine.
	
After you login, you will be prompted to change the new (LDAP) password. You should paste in the password retreived from
SAFE again, and then you will be prompted to type in your new, easy-to-remember password, twice. 
Your password must comply with the  [Service password policy](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/about/policies/passwords_usernames).
	
Note that when you change your password on the service machine  in this way, this is not reflected on the SAFE.

## <a id="tracking"></a> Tracking and Managing Available Resources

### <a id="ures"></a> How to check how much time and space are available to you

1. [Login to SAFE](#login).
2. Go to the Menu *Login accounts*, select the *username* which you wish to 
see details for.  

You will then see the information for this account. You will see the quotas for the disk space (if the
project group is using these) and how much is in use.  You can also see which file systems your project
is using under the heading 'Volume', followed by the current usage by your project, and total quota.
Quotas that are close to being full are hightlighted.

The budget values displayed are updated every morning, and the values shown for disk use are updated
four times a day. For this reason, all these values may not be completely up-to-date. If there is a
lot of activity in your project, the numbers shown could be significantly different from from the
current ones.

### <a id="resources"></a> How to request more budget or disk space

In the first instance, please contact the principal investigator, or the project manager of your project.
The PI will then take the necessary steps to either allocate you more resources out of the project
reserve, or to request an increase from the service desk/research councils.

The Service desk does not own project resources and has no authority to allocate them to individual users.
This responsibility lies with the project PI/project manager.

### <a id="uhist"></a> How to review the use you have made of the service, or the activity of the service as a whole

1. [Login to SAFE](#login).
2. Go to the Menu *Service information* and select *Reports*
3. Select the report you wish to run
4. Complete the required information in the form: this will usually consist of at least a date range to
   analyse and may have other options depending on the report you are running.
4. Click on the output format you want to use (Preview, HTML, PDF, CSV)

The report will be generated and displayed.
	
If you initially selected Preview and would now like this report in one of the other formats, scroll down
to the bottom of the report and you can now click the format you want and the same report parameters will
be used to generate the report.

If you are a PI or Project Manager, you will have access to additional reports to generate information on
whole projects or groups as well as your own usage and the usage of the service as a whole.

### <a id="jobs"></a>  How to see a report of all your jobs and their usage

1. [Login to SAFE](#login).
2. Go to the Menu *Login Accounts* and select the machine account you want to report on

4. Select a time period which would cover the time the job ended e.g. starting one week prior to today for 1 month 
5. Click on *Preview*

All the jobs run by that account will be listed, including information on when they were submitted, started and ended, and the Raw Usage, which is a note of the time used on the machine, and Charged Usage, which will usually be the same as the Raw Usage, but will be Zero for uncharged jobs.

## <a id="pubs"></a> Tracking Publications (DOI)

The SAFE includes functionality for tracking pulications associated with
projects by registering DOI (Digital Object Identifiers) and automatically
collecting metadata.

Once registered, lists of DOIs can be exported in a format suitable for
uploading to ResearchFish.

This functionality can be particularly useful for large projects where 
there is a requirement to capture outputs from a large number of users.

!!! important
    Adding publications is currently only possible in EPCC SAFE, not DiRAC SAFE

### <a id="regdoi"></a> How to register a publication in SAFE

!!! important
    Adding publications is currently only possible in EPCC SAFE, not DiRAC SAFE

You will need a DOI for the publication you wish to register. A DOI

At the moment we support export lists of DOIs to comma-separated values (CSV) files. This
does not export all the metadata, just the DOIs themselves with a maximum of 25 DOIs per line.
This format is primarily useful for importing into ResearchFish (where you can paste in the
comma-separated lists to import publications). We plan to add further export formats in the future.
